# dotfiles

personal dotfiles and shell setup

## Installation

Run `make` to install all dotfiles. It is recommended to inspect the `Makefile`
and apply targets selectively.

Dotfiles typically are symlinked to this repository, which makes it easy to
compare/exchange upstream and local changes.

### vim

Requires version 8+ (built-in packages) with `+python3` (check `vim --version` output).
